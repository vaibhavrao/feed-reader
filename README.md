## Instructions

### Contents

The project contains an 'index.html' file that not only displays the feeds, but also the result of the tests at the bottom of the page.

The tests in this project use [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)

All the tests validate the basic behavior of the Feed Reeder app. This test suite can be further expanded should more customized behavior be added to the Feed views (e.g. Inline previews of individual Feed items upon hover over individual items OR Support for keyboard based scrolling is added).

The tests ensure that:

1. None of the tests are dependent on the results of another test.
2. Callbacks are used to ensure that feeds are loaded before they are tested
